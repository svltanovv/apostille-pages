    <h2 style="color: #0b3d91;">Apostille and Legalization e-Register</h2>
    <p>The Apostille and Legalization e-Register was developed to combat fraud and abuse of the apostille or legalization certificate and further modification of the underlying public document. With the Apostille and Legalization e-Register, any interested party can verify the fact of apostillization or legalization of a document, visually verify the Apostille or Legalization Certificate, and view the scanned version of the underlying document.</p>
    
    <p>The growing adoption of the electronic apostille (e-Apostille) marks a significant advance in international document authentication. As more countries and authorities adopt this digital solution, the process of verifying documents for global use becomes increasingly streamlined and efficient. The e-Apostille system provides a secure and reliable method for authenticating a wide range of documents, from personal certificates to legal documents, thereby facilitating smoother international interactions.</p>
    
    <p>Despite its growing popularity, it is crucial to recognize that the adoption of the e-Apostille is not yet universal, and the states parties to the convention have historically maintained electronic registers disjointedly.</p>
    
    <p>The introduction of a unified <strong>E-APOSTILLE GLOBAL</strong> information system, which performs the functions of interacting with all registers of the states parties to the convention with the ability to verify and legalize documents, is a revolutionary step towards the digitalization and simplification of international document legalization.</p>

        <p style="margin-top: 0;"><em>* To connect to the system, you must contact the system operator.</em></p>
        <p><em>* To verify documents issued before January 15, 2026, you must contact the national electronic apostille register of the country that legalized the document.</em></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><em>* In countries that have adopted this system, there may still be specific requesting authorities or institutions that are unfamiliar with e-Apostille or hesitant to accept it. This difference in adoption levels highlights the importance of understanding the specific requirements of the destination country or authority.</em></p>
